## Required Screenshots

For the best presentation in the Kotlin Multiplatform Contest, please add the following screenshots:

1. **`timeline_android.png`** - Timeline screen showing planned vs actual events on Android
   - Recommended size: 1080x2340 pixels (portrait)
   - Should show both Planned Events and Log Events side by side
   - Include the timer button and category colors

2. **`timeline_ios.png`** - Same Timeline screen on iOS
   - Recommended size: 1170x2532 pixels (iPhone 14 Pro portrait)
   - Should match the Android screenshot to showcase UI consistency
   - Demonstrates Compose Multiplatform's unified UI

3. **`report_android.png`** - Report screen with AI-generated KPT feedback
   - Show the generated feedback with Keep/Problem/Try sections
   - Include graphs or analytics if available
   - Demonstrates the Gemini AI integration

## Tips for Great Screenshots

- Use a **clean, realistic dataset** (not lorem ipsum or test data)
- Ensure **good lighting** and contrast
- Show **real features** in action (timer running, feedback displayed, etc.)
- Use **consistent time of day** across screenshots
- Consider using **device frames** for professional look (optional)

## Tools for Creating Screenshots

- **Android**: Android Studio's Device Screenshot tool or `adb screencap`
- **iOS**: Xcode's Screenshot tool (⌘S in Simulator) or Physical device screenshots
- **Device Frames**: [mockuphone.com](https://mockuphone.com/) or [screely.com](https://screely.com/)

## Alternative: Demo GIF

If you prefer animated demos, you can replace static screenshots with GIFs:
- Record screen using **Kap** (macOS), **ScreenToGif** (Windows), or **Peek** (Linux)
- Keep file size under 10MB for GitHub
- Show key interactions: creating events, starting timer, generating AI feedback
